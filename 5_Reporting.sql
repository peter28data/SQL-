The company will be involved in hosting an Olympic games event and would like a report on both the winter and summer sports to be centralized. Create a query that shows a unique number of events held for each sport. The UNION functions will combine both datasets and exclude null values. The result will be a column for sports and the number of events that occur within each sport.  */

WHERE -- Used when filtering on a dimension
HAVING -- Used when filtering on an aggregation, such as SUM(revenue)

-- Option A: JOIN first, UNION second
SELECT
athlete_id,
gender,
age,
gold
FROM summer_games AS sg

-----------------------------Now combine with UNION
UNION ALL

SELECT

--------------------------Now turn this into subquery
