This will give us a count of how many customers are registering every month. Finally we will order by month ascending to give us the new customer registrations KPI for the first 3 months of the year.

-- Active Users KPI: Counts the active users of a company's app over a time period by day or by month. (DAU or MAU). Your food delivery company, Delivr, would like to know the 'Stickiness' that measures how often users engage with an app on average. An example of this metric would be if users engage with the app 9 days over 30 days in a month's time on average, this would return a 'Stickiness' metric of 30% (DAU/MAU).
-- To get this metric, we would query how many different customers are using the delivery app every month, extract the month the order was placed and group by the extracted month.

-- SUM(regs) OVER (ORDER BY delivr_month ASC) 
-- The use case for window functions is to perform an operation across a set of rows related to the current row. The registrations KPI only counts registrations by month, but what if you want the registered users overall by month? You can't compare the current and previous months' monthly active users unless the two values are in one row. This is why window functions are useful.
-- Running Total: A cumulative sum of a variable's previous values.

/* Monthly Active Users (MAU) Pitfalls
Case 1: 100 users register every month but only stay active for 1 month
Case 2: 100 users register the first month, stay active, but no new registrations afterwards.
Both Cases MAUs will be 100
Users who were not active the previous month but returned to activity this month are labeled 'Resurrected users'. 

Retention Rate: The CTE will store a list of months and the users that were active in these months by selecting the distinct order dates, truncated to the month, and the user IDs. The final query will select the previous month then, count the distinct active users in the current month and divide them by the count of distinct active users in the current month. By casting the numerator to NUMERIC and rounding the results, a cleaner output is returned. The GREATEST function is used to avoid dividing by zero, in case the previous month has zero active users. In case it does, it defaults to 1. Finally select from the CTE as 'previous' for previous month. Then, left join on the same CTE aliased as 'current'. The common key should be user ID and the previous month being equal to the current month minus an interval of one month. This way, you 'peek into' the future and see whether a user stayed in the month after the previous month.

The Unit Economic ARPU measures a company's success in scaling its business model and can be useful to secure financial loans based on future projections at the current Unit Economics and other growth rates.
