SAP - Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing

SAP is a suite of software applications that allow companies to standardize processes across departments and countries. For industries such as Oil & Gas, Utilities & Energy, Manufacturing (automotive, electronics), and Retail, SAP is used to:
1. Gather requirements
2. Process modeling
3. Data Analysis
4. Reporting & KPIs
5. Testing & UAT

ERP - Enterprise Resource Planning
SAP is a ERP system, connecting different departments such as Finance & Accounting, HR, Sales & Customer Service, Procurement & Inventory, and Supply Chain & Logistics in one unified database to share real-time data. This also allows companies to audit trails to meet strict compliance needs. The goal for this program is to be equipped to help businesses streamline their operations, improve customer experiences, and ultimately increase their profitability.

This program for Business Analysts is segmented into four courses.
1. Foundations of Business Analysis
  introduction to BA
  Software development lifecycle
  agile and hybrid methodlologies
  BA role in project delivery
2. Requirements Gathering and Documentation
3. Business Process Modeling and Analysis
4. Strategic Analysis and Solution Design

Foundations of Business Analysis highlights a structured approach for analyzing business problems and identifying opportunities. Developing a value proposition statement and success metric to effectively measure the impact of work. Business Analysts work with companies to understand specific business requirements. They analyze the current processes and drill down to find the precise areas that need to be improved. Next, they work with the technical team to design and implement solutions. BAs make sure the solutions from the technical team meet the specific business needs of the company. Therefore, BAs help improve efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, and drive growth for the businesses. 

Example Scenario: You are tasked with analyzing sales data to identify trends and improve sales forecasting. SAP Analytics Cloud can be used to create dashboards to show seasonal patterns, regional differences, and product performance. BAs might recommend to adjust inventory levels, target specific customer groups, or introduce new products. SAP Signavio is used to create flowcharts to display the flow of processes. This can also be used to display the relationship between a customer and a supplier when a customer places an order. Creating a quick model in SAP Signavio begins with defining user activities, populating the swim lanes under each activity, and organizing by the 'who' and linking process tasks in the diagram.

Frameworks such as Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) help to map out and visualize how processes work such as order fulfillment, inventory management, and supply chain operations. One major issue could be manual data entry to check stock availability for order fulfillment will slow the process down. Inventory tracking is not in real-time, therefore, some items may appear available when out of stock leading to frustrated customers and missed sales. The solution is to implement barcode scanning, mobile app scanning with SAP S/4HANA to manage inventory in real-time to provide accurate stock information. This improves backend efficiancy but to deliver value to the customer an improvement on delivery and shopping experience are focused. 

Leveraging ChatGPT for SWOT/PESTLE analysis can give a business analyst an edge. To explore options on how to deal with a competitive threat, a prompt can be written as so: "What are the potential competitive advantages and disadvantages of the competitor's solution compared to our proposed SAP S/4HANA implementation?" The answer can go in the "ChaptGPT Insights" section of a Business Case Analysis Report to highlight the role of AI in the analysis process and to demonstrate how to effectively utilize AI to generate insights. The executive summary provides a concise overview of the business case, key findings, and recommendations. 

The most significant contribution of business analysis frameworks in defining effective requirements for an SAP solution is to enable alignment between the SAP solution and business needs. Frameworks ensure the solution solves the right problem by guiding the process of understanding the business context and translating it into actionable requirements. 

Value proposition to implement new Enterprise Resource Planning systems should be different for every stakeholder. The selling point for shop floor workers would be to save energy and time by removing the foot traffic they would need to gain access to essential information such as inventory levels, production levels, and ensuring quality checks. For warehouse staff managing shipments and organizing warehouse space can be automated. For production managers, gaining real-time data to dashboards to track Key Performance Indicators and highlight areas for improvement can enable managers to make faster decisions and allow for more time for consideration. Sales and marketing teams need to respond to customers fast with ERP systems. For IT departments, built-in compliance features and robust security protocols minimizes the risk of breaches to allow IT teams to focus on innovation rather than routine maintenance. Another benefit to employees is making their jobs easier, teaching new skils, or improving career opportunities. A consideration is to be early, upfront, and show concern openly with employees about the challenges a new implementation project can be. 

SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) help to optimize stock levels, reduce downtime, and improve production efficiency. SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP) is for demand forecasting that can improve decision-making for supply chain optimization. SAP EWM can be used for better inventory control to also improve supply chain. To decide which technology is the better option, a cost-benefit analysis can be broken down into implementation costs, ongoing costs, expected benefits, and risks such as a high learning curve for Warehouse Management could lead to a temporary inefficiency before full adoption. 

Defining measurable outcomes create clear goals to guide work, track progress, and prove impact to stakeholders. A vague statement "We want a better HR system" can be broken down into boosting employee engagement by comparing satisfaction scores through surveys, speed up hiring from 45 days to 30 days with ATS, automated job postings, improve employee retention with better career development programs with course completion rates to reduce turnover by 10%, improve development with training programs increasing participation by 20% and checking if employees are applying the upskilling they have sought. 

Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timed goals empower ideas to be promoted in a structured and compelling case to executives and managers with a meaningful impact. For example, working with the Accounts Payable Department to reduce late payments and enhance Days Payable Outstanding to 20 days. The current late payment rate is 85% and reducing this by 15% is attainable. 

What is the key contribution of an SAP business analyst in a large-scale SAP implementation for a global company looking to standardize its business processes across all subsidiaries.
X manage the training implementation, training teams handle this
Y BA should identify commonalities and differences in processes to harmonize diverse business processes within the SAP system.

What is the first step a BA should take when improving a company's order fulfillment process.

Y BA should work with users to capture their needs and perspectives to understand stakeholder wants and needs.

Which approach is the most persuasive in demonstrating the value of the SAP system upgrade to senior management?
X presenting the benefits through case studies of other companies that benefitted, it will only act as a support to the actual solution

When researching other industries' approaches to value and success measurement a key question to consider is what are the key factors that drive value in their industries and how they relate to the current industry's drivers.

Which skill will help the analyst produce clear and structured documentation?
X facilitating workshops and stakeholder discussions

The Software Development Life Cycle allows BAs to communicate better with developers, so that you can bridge the gap with information they need at any stage to reduce errors and delays. The planning phase involves the projects scope and objectives, necessary resources, and timeline. The analysis phase is when the BA gathers requirements from stakeholders to identify the problems the software is meant to solve. The design phase covers user interface, database structure, and system architecture. The development is writing actual code. Testing phase includes functional testing, performance testing, and security testing. deployment phase rolling out to sample customers, migrating data or training users. Maintenance phase includes regular updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to remain effective.

The SAP Activate methodology is an agile framework. It includes Project preparation, Blueprint, Realization, Final preparation, and Go-live & support. Key principles include agile and iterative approach such as breaking down projects into smaller, manageable sprints. A sprint focuses on delivering specific functionalities, enabling rapid deployment and validation. SAP Activate divides the project lifecycle into six phases; Discover, Prepare, Explore, Realize, Deploy, Run. The Discover phase is for gathering high-level requirements to understand the overall needs and scope. The Prepare phase conducts detailed workshops to gather specific requirements such as inventory management, batch tracking, and order fulfillment; it involves understanding the detailed needs of stakeholders. The realize phase focuses on building and configuring the system to meet specific requirements

Traditional Waterfall approaches struggle to keep up with the fast paced environment so Agile methods focus on specific functionality for rapid deployment and validation. Targeting sprints produces something tangible and helps to confirm that the solution is moving in the right direction. It begins with requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment. The key difference is with an Agile methodoly a minimum viable product is presented to the customer to gather feedback to plan for the next sprint. Scrum is a popular agile framework that provides a structured approach to managing complex projects. The scrum helps the team overcome obstacles and removes any impediments that are preventing the team from making progress. The product owner defines what the product should do and are responsible for creating and maintaining the product backlog, a prioritized list of features and requirements for the product.

Daily Scrum is a 15 minute meeting where the team discusses what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any obstacles they are facing. Sprint Planning is where the product owner presents the product backlog items and the Devlepment Team selects the items they will commit to completing during the sprint. Sprint Review is where the team demonstrates the working product to the stakeholders. Sprint Retrospective is where the team reflects on the sprint. They discuss what went well, what could be improved, how they can work more effectively in the future. 

Kanban and Scrum are agile frameworks however Kanban focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency. By limiting the number of items being worked on for each "production line", the team can identify bottlenecks, reduce waste, and optimize the flow of value. 

Implementing a system for ongoing feedback and collabortive interactions with all stakeholder groups is generally the most effective for managing stakeholder involvement to support the project's success.

A significant challenge when choosing the waterfall method is the difficulty in adapting to evolving requirements, regarding accessbility and user feedback, within the existing system. 

SAP Active's most significant consideration is the methodology's ability to smoothly integrate with and leverage the existing SAP System's functionalilties, adhering to SAP best practices. 

If a key assumption about a company turned out to be incorrect it might lead to reconsidering the methodology choice, as different assumptions could favor a different approach.

Accessibility requirements influence methodology selection as ongoing accessiblity improvements favor a methodology iterative development, testing, and user feedback. 

Using an agile apprach to implement SAP S/4HANA the challenge of changing requirements uses short iterations to develop and test features allowing for adjustments based on feedback and changing needs. The iterative nature of sprints allows for flexibility.

Scrum is more structered than Kanban when roles are defined with fixed-length sprints, whereas Kanban focuses on improving the workflow with visuals, more flexibility, and continuous flow to allow the team to adapt to specific needs. 

Jira, how to create a workflow plan in Jira for project management, an atlassian product. Once in the project, choose create on the right most side of the tabs. A pop-up for "Create" appears and the issue type dropdown will have an epic option. The summary is more of a title, therefore label it Requirements Gathering. Repeat this process for System Configuration, and Testing and Deployment. A seprate issue, Story should have the summary "Conduct Stakeholder Interviews" with the Parent dropdown have the option for Requirements Gathering Epic. Another Story "Document Functional Requirements" also under Requirements Gathering Epic. A third Story, "Document technical requirements" to the same Epic. 

The leftside of the Jira software will have a Pane for Timelines, which include the Epics, and a Pane for Backlog for Stories. In the menu on the right, after clicking the story, select add and then child issue, the subtask field should be filled with "schedule interviews with stakeholders". After selecting create, click the same story and the subtask will appear. Another subtask should be made for "Prepare interview questions" and another for "conduct interviews".

DEVELOPING A BA WORKFLOW PLAN IN JIRA
Which Jira Issue represents the major phases of the "Senior Scam Prevention Workshop" - planning the workshop content?
Epic

Its important to define epics to establish an overall structure, provide a high-level view of the project's major phases, and key components of the project.

Epic "Logistics and Promotion" for the Project "Senior Scam Prevention Workshop", a Story represents individual actions such as "Secure workshop venue".

Breaking down the Story into subtasks help to clarify the steps needed to complete each story and ensure no critical actions are overlooked.

The Primary purpose of a sprint is to define a timeframe to track and manage all workshop tasks.

The Primary benefit of moving tasks in the Jira board columns is to visually track the progress of each task.
