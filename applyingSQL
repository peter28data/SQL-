#1 Aggregating Finances: 
Difference of active/Non-active Users
The following query will return two records grouped by active status, 'false' or 'true'. The selected fields are active status, number of transactions in each active status, the average amount spent in each active status, and the total amount spend by active status.

SELECT
  active,
  COUNT(payment_id) AS num_transactions,
  AVG(amount) AS avg_amount,
  SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM payment AS p
INNER JOIN customer AS c
ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY active;



#2 Aggregating Strings: 
Demonstrate family-friendly/multi-lingual films
The query below will return a column with a list of all the different languages following by a column including all the film titles that are available in that language. This query demonstrates only films released in 2010 with a 'G' rating by combining two tables on the primary key 'language_id'.
SELECT
  name,
  STRING_AGG(title, ',') AS film_titles
FROM film AS f
INNER JOIN language AS l
  ON f.language_id = l.language_id
WHERE release_year = 2010
  AND rating = 'G'
GROUP BY name;



#3 Navigating Database
A database can have hundreds of tables and individually selecting all columns from each table would be an inefficient way to scrub through the tables for the right data to answer a business question. An efficient way is to query the list of tables by querying a specific system table such as Postgres or Oracle. This returns schema name, table name, and table owner such as Postgres
SELECT *
FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

# SQL Server - TSQL
SELECT *
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;

# MySQL
SHOW TABLES;

#4 VIEW columns from tables
CREATE VIEW table_columns AS 
SELECT 
  table_name,
  STRING_AGG(column_name, ', ') AS columns
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
GROUP BY table_name;
SELECT *
FROM table_columns



#5 Aggregate Film Lenths
The query returns a report of the average length of films grouped by categories, joined by two tables on a unique identifier for the films.
SELECT category,
  AVG(length) AS average_length
FROM film AS f
INNER JOIN category AS c
ON f.film_id = c.film_id
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY average_length;




#6 Aggregate Film Rentals
Returning number of rentals in each city to identify business opportunities for the best customer contrasting the potential detractors.
Join the 'rental' table and 'address' table for city information
Problem: There is no common key between these tables so we use the 'customer' table because it has a field in 'rental' and address'. Visually connected the three tables is a process called 



#7 Which Films are most Rented?
'films' table has rental duration 
'rental' table has which customer rented the films
There is no common id.
'inventory' table has film_id from 'films' and inventory_id from 'rental'.
SELECT
  title,
  COUNT(title)
FROM film AS f
INNER JOIN inventory AS i
ON f.film_id = i.film_id
INNER JOIN rental AS r
ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY count DESC;



#8 Change Data Type
Convert to new data type for the duration of the query. This can be done with the casting function of double notation. Converting to integer will results in losing the decimals of each point of data.
SELECT 
  CAST(total_column AS integer)
FROM prices
SELECT total_column::integer
FROM prices


#9 Data Type
SELECT
  revenues_change::integer,
  COUNT(*)
FROM fortune500
GROUP BY revenues_change::integer
ORDER BY revuenes_change;


#10 Count Positive 
How many of the Fortune 500 companies had revenues increase in 2017
SELECT 
  COUNT(*)
FROM fortune500
WHERE revenues_change > 0;



#11 Validating
Check 'unanswered_pct' by trying to recreate the data
SELECT
  unanswered_count/question_count::numeric AS computed_pct,
  unanswered_pct
FROM stackoverflow
WHERE question_count !=0
LIMIT 10;



#12 Truncate and Group
The query groups values in the 'unanswered_count' column intro three groups based on digits in the tens place of the number, due to the second argument of the truncate function being -1.
SELECT
  TRUNC(unanswered_count, -1) AS trunc_ua,
  COUNT(*)
FROM stackoverflow
WHERE tag='amazon-ebs'
GROUP BY trunc_ua
ORDER BY trunc_ua



#13 Correlation
SELECT 
  CORR(assets, equity)
FROM fortune500;



#14 Percentiles
Discrete returns a real value, whereas Continuous may not return a real value.
SELECT
  PERCENTILE_DISC(.5) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY val),
  PERCENTILE_CONT(.5) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY val)
FROM nums;



#15 Temporary tables
CREATE 
  TEMP TABLE top_companies AS 
SELECT 
  rank, 
  title
FROM fortune500
WHERE rank <= 10;
SELECT column1, column2
  INTO TEMP TABLE new_tablename
FROM table;



#16 Add Data
This adds all row data from ranking companies 11 through 20
INSERT INTO top_companies
SELECT
  rank, 
  title
FROM fortune500
WHERE rank BETWEEN 11 AND 20;



#17 Delete Table
This wont cause an error if the table does not exist.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS top_companies;



#18 Correlation Temp
CREATE TEMP TABLE correlations AS 
SELECT
  'profits';;vvarchar AS measure,
  corr(profits, profits) AS profits,
  corr(profits, profits_change) AS profits_change,
  corr(profits, revenues_change) AS revenues_change
FROM fortune500;



#19  Add to Temp
INSERT INTO correlations
SELECT
  'profits_change'::varchar AS measure,
  corr(profits_change, profits) AS profits,
  corr(profits_change, profits_change) AS profits_change,
  corr(profits_change, revenues_change) AS revenues_change
FROM fortune500;
INSERT INTO correlations
SELECT
  'revenues_change'::varchar AS measure,
  corr(revenues_change, profits) AS profits,
  corr(revenues_change, profits_change) AS profits_change,
  corr(revenues_change, revenues_change) AS revenues_change
FROM fortune500;



#20 Rounding
SELECT measure,
  round(profits::numeric, 2) AS profits,
  round(profits_change::numeric, 2) AS profits_change
  round(revenues_change::numeric, 2) AS revenues_change
FROM correlations;



#21 Categorical Unstructured Text
Cat values examples are responses in a survey question or days of the week whereas unstructured text are summaries for book reviews.



#23 Count
This is data on help requests submitted to the city of Evanston, IL.
How many distinct values of zip appear in at least 100 rows?
SELECT 
  zip,
  count(*)
FROM evanston311
GROUP BY zip
HAVING count(*) >=100;



#24 Most Common
Find the five most common values of 'street' column and a count of each
SELECT
  street,
  count(*)
FROM evanston311
GROUP BY street
ORDER BY count(*) DESC
LIMIT 5;



#25 Potential Problems
Explore distinct values of 'street' column and count the number of rows. When sorting the results by street it will show similar values near each other. This identifies potential problems such as; The s



#26 Without whitespace
The following query will return values of 'apple' but will not return values that have whitespace before or after, and will not return plural versions of 'apple'.
SELECT *
FROM fruit_table
WHERE lower(fruit_column)='apple';



#27 Case insensitive
This query will return plural versions of 'apple' and is a scalable version of the 'like' function because it returns values that are upper and lower case whereas the 'like' function only returns lower case as in the query below.
SELECT *
FROM fruit_table
WHERE fruit_column LIKE '%apple%';
SELECT *
FROM fruit_table
WHERE fruit_colulmn ILIKE '%apple%';



#28 Limits
This will return values such as pineapple since apple is in the value. Another way to return values without whitespace is to use the trim function. This removes space from left and right side. 'rtrim' and 'ltrim' to specify sides.
SELECT trim(' abc '):



#29 Limits
The previous funcion only removes spaces but not tabs or new lines in the value. Using the second argument we can specify which characters to remove. This would return the value 'o' since all other characters were specified.
SELECT trim('Wow!', '!wW');



#30 Combining
We can execute the lower function to the first argument of the trim function so that we do not have to specify the upper case 'W' in the second argument of the trim function.
SELECT trim(lower('Wow!'), '!w');



#31 Frequent Categories
The query goes through inquires from for help. The goal is to see how well the 'category' captures what is in the 'description'. The method is to find inquires that mention trash or garbage in the description without those keywords in the category. What is the most frequent categories for these constraints.
SELECT
  category, count(*)
FROM evanston311
WHERE (description ILIKE '%trash%'
OR description ILIKE '%garbage%')
AND category NOT LIKE '%Trash%'
AND category NOT LIKE '%Garbage%';
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT
  left('abcde', 2),r
